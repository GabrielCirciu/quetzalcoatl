To do:

Fixing and slight improvements:
	On join message and chat texts recentering check
	Restructure data bytes for better serialization ie: [!o1]
	Add On-Disconnect message and remove from player list
	Make Single-Player actually single-player (or private server)

Set up synchronization:
	On player join, spawn them in
	For new players, spawn all existing players in
	Synchronize position and rotation of each player

Set up all menu items:
	Use the designed UI layout for the game
	Implement every menu button, slider, dropdown
	Set up every aspect to be functional
	Implement in-game menu, with full functionality
	Set up placeholders for unused menus

Set up Server Creation UI and savings:
	When hosting server, Server Name should be given
	Server should handle saving all data in a folder / files

Set up, and update previous, file management/ saving:
	Update and improve File Manager script to handles all data file saves
	(Set up temporary world creation just for foldering purposes)
	Main Folder will be: ../AppData/LocalLow/%Company/%Game/.. (persistentPath)
	Options Save file will be: ../%Game/Config.cfg
	Other Save files/folders will be: ../%Game/Saves/..
	Character's Folders will be: ../Saves/Characters/..
	World's Folders will be: ../Saves/Worlds/..
	Character <ANY> Data file will be: ../Characters/Character_Name_UID/%Data.dat
	World's Data Folders will be: ../Worlds/%World_Name_UID/..
	World <ANY> Data file will be: ../%World_Name_UID/%Data.dat

Set up Character creation:
	Set up full character creation UI functionality with Create/Delete
	Implement character customization and saving it to a file/ loading it
	Character customizer should include for now: Character Name, Base Color
	Saving/Loading should be handled by an identifier: Name <UID>

Set up Character sync over server:
	Implement server sync of custom character features to be loaded on join
	Server should handle keeping track of all players (position/rotation/customization)
	All tracked player data is sent to new client on join
	Client should save all server related data periodically to keep track at re-joining
	Data includes: ServerWorldID, Position, Rotation, Character Features
